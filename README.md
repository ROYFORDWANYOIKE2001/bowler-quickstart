# Bowler SBT Quickstart
The Bowler Quickstart is a Skeleton sbt project and Bowler app that gets you up and running with a minimal Bowler app that you can adapt in no time.

## Setup Instructions
* Have [Simple Build Tool ("sbt")](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) installed
* Create the directory where you want to start your app and run "git init"
* Do  "git pull https://github.com/wfaler/bowler-quickstart.git"
* Run sbt
* To check that it is working, type "container:start" to start a Jetty servlet container on port 8080, and visit http://localhost:8080/
* Done! Ready to start writing your Bowler app!
